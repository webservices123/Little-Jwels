          This inspiring quote describes the journey of Little Jewels
          Kindergarten since 2010. My love for children motivated me to embark
          on a journey depicting me and my team's and my ongoing perseverance,
          innovative thinking and the potential to turn hopes and dreams into
          happening realities. Little Jewels Kindergarten opened its doors in a
          temporary premises. With God's grace it has grown from a cradle, into
          a much promising wholesome environment throwing light on the meaning
          of what a kindergarten actually is.

          Little Jewels Kindergarten has always placed greater emphasis on the
          quality of teaching and learning, by inculcating moral values and
          all-encompassing life skills. It provides little children a platform
          to get familiar with and practice these skills, develop them and
          broaden their growth horizon. I feel that you will discover, Little
          Jewels Kindergarten is a place where your child will grow, learn,
          become confident, creative, happy and above all be loved.
